## Traditional summer internships in data science are broken.  

A summer is too short to dig into a real-world data science problem.  Instead, a typical intern is given a practice exercise.  But then the employer will not learn how the intern grapples with real-world problems, and the intern will not learn whether he or she truly enjoys working on them!  

## The solution is to maintain an internship for at least a year.  

Then the intern will have time to learn a larger code base, fix tougher bugs, and come back to documentation he wrote six months earlier and discover how unclear it is!  The intern might even have enough time to shed light on a problem that is of real interest to the employer.

Employers often don't employ undergraduate interns for a full year either because the interns attend school out of town or because training interns is so time consuming.  To circumvent these problems, Aerisun hires undergraduate interns from Milwaukee universities (UWM, MSOE, and Marquette) and takes on the responsibility of training those interns in data science.

## Aerisun trains data-science students year round

When a Milwaukee-area employer agrees to hire an intern, then:

1.  Aerisun works with the employer to recruit an undergraduate intern.  
1.  The employer assigns a data-science problem.
1.  Aerisun and the intern work on the problem, in collaboration with the employer.  
1.  Regular meetings with the employer are held to keep the project on track.  

Work continues full-time during the summer and part-time during the school year.

The goal is two-fold: 
    
1.  to train the future data science workforce of Milwaukee-area employers, and 
1.  in so doing, to solve specific data-science problems that are meaningful to those employers.

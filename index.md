# Aerisun's internship program

## The problem with traditional internships in data science

Traditional summer internships in data science are suboptimal.  A summer is too short to dig into a real-world data science problem.  So interns are given make-work problems instead.  But then, at the conclusion of summer, the employer does not know how whether the intern can solve real-world problems, and the intern does not know whether he will enjoy working on real-world problems.  

## Aerisun's solution

The solution is to keep the intern for at least a year.  Then the intern will have time to learn a larger code base, fix tougher bugs, and come back to documentation he wrote six months earlier and discover how unclear it is!  The intern might even shed light on a problem that is of real interest to the employer.

Employers often don't hire interns for a full year either because interns attend school out of town or because training interns is so time consuming.  Aerisun hires undergraduates from Milwaukee-area universities (UWM, MSOE, and Marquette) and takes on the responsibility of training those interns in data science.  Aerisun has a long history of working with undergraduates at UWM and MSOE. 

## How it works

When a Milwaukee-area employer agrees to hire an intern, then Aerisun, in collaboration with the employer, recruits an undergraduate intern.  The employer assigns a data-science problem, and then Aerisun trains the intern and works collaboratively with him.  Regular meetings with the employer are held to keep the project on track.

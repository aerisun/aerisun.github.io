# <span style="color: #155799;"> Aerisun's internship program </span>

## Traditional summer internships in data science are broken.  

A summer is too short to dig into a real-world data science problem.  So interns are typically given practice exercises instead.  But then the employer will not learn how the intern grapples with real-world problems, and the intern will not learn whether he truly enjoys working on them!  

## The solution is to maintain the internship for at least a year.  

Then the intern will have time to learn a larger code base, fix tougher bugs, and come back to documentation he wrote six months earlier and discover how unclear it is!  The intern might even shed light on a problem that is of real interest to the employer.

Employers often don't employ undergraduate interns for a full year either because the interns attend school out of town or because training interns is so time consuming.  To circumvent these problems, Aerisun hires undergraduate interns from Milwaukee universities (UWM, MSOE, and Marquette) and takes on the responsibility of training those interns in data science.  Aerisun has a long history of working with undergraduates at UWM and MSOE. 

## How Aerisun's internship program works:

When a Milwaukee-area employer agrees to hire an intern, then Aerisun, in collaboration with the employer, recruits an undergraduate intern.  The employer assigns a data-science problem, and then, to address the problem, Aerisun trains the intern and works collaboratively with him and the employer.  Regular meetings with the employer are held to keep the project on track.  Work continues full-time during the summer and part-time during the school year.

The goal is two-fold: to train the future data scientists of Milwaukee-area employers, and in so doing, to address specific data-science problems that are meaningful to those employers.

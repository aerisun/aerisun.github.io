# Aerisun: Better Data-science internship programs for Milwaukee-area employers and undergraduates

## The problem with internships in data science

Traditional summer internships in data science are suboptimal.  A summer is too short to dig into a real-world data science problem.  So interns are given make-work problems instead.  But then, at the conclusion of summer, the employer does not know how whether the intern can solve real-world problems, and the intern does not know whether he will enjoy working on real-world problems.  

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Aerisun's solution

The solution is to keep the intern for at least a year.  Then the intern will have time to learn a larger code base, fix tougher bugs, and come back to documentation he wrote six months earlier and discover how unclear it is!  The intern might even shed light on a problem that is of real interest to the employer.

Employers often don't hire interns for a full year either because interns attend school out of town or because training interns is so time consuming.  Aerisun hires undergraduates from Milwaukee-area universities (UWM, MSOE, and Marquette) and takes on the responsibility of training those interns in data science.  Aerisun has a long history of working with undergraduates at UWM and MSOE. 

## How it works

When a Milwaukee-area employer agrees to hire an intern, Aerisun, in collaboration with the employer, will recruit an undergraduate intern.  The employer will assign a data-science problem, and then Aerisun will train the intern and work collaboratively with him to make progress on the problem.  Regular meetings with the employer will be scheduled to keep the project on track.
